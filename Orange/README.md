Orange input data can be presented in different formats (.tab, .csv...), but must respect a formalism : a three lines header must be added !
First line figure your data features (names)
Second line indicates data type (continuous or c, discrete or d, string or s)
Third line indicates feature type (meta or m, class or c, nothing (blank) for other relevant feature)

For example :

feature1	feature2	feature3
c	d	d
	m	c
